# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This week, we created a Team Profile Generator that created an HTML page once we circled through a series questions on team members we work with. 
The questions ask generic details on team members, and when we finish the questionarie, an html file opens with cards containing our answers. 

## Installation
This application can be run using the terminal with node.
When we run node index.js, we are prompted with a series of questions on our team members. 

## Usage
You would use this application if you wanted to create cards for the members of your team. 
The application also uses Jest to run tests against the quality of input (methods and objects) within our class files. 
We used inquirer to prompt the questionaire within the terminal.
We applied CSS and HTML linking so rendered page had styling features applied.

## Lessons
We covered alot of ground in the creation of this application. 
We learnt how to use require to link files. 
We deployed concepts around the Class model, extending Class variables (ie Employee) with more specific variables (ie, Manager, Intern). 
We used inquirer to generate questions and closed out the questionaire with a 'write file' code so html files would generate. 
We deployed a helper file to house the html language that dynamically passed through variables so our page would generate our input. 
We utilised Jest dependencies so proper testing could be completed on Employee data methods and objects. 
Please note, all tests returned successfully.

## Conclusion
This was a big project with some challenges, but well worth the effort in the end. 
Much was taken away from this project and we grew our confidence in working across multiple files and languages.
